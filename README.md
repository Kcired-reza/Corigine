## Author: Derick Nyende
1. The program gets the factorial of the given numer and stores it in variable 'a'.
2. A variable 'ans' is created to store the summation and is initialised with a value of 0.
3. Variable 'a' is modded by 10 in order to get the last digit of the factorial.
4. This number is then added to 'ans'.
5. Variable 'a' is then integer divided by 10 in order to drop the last digit.
6. The process repeats from step 3-5 until variable 'a' is equal to zero.
7. The summation stored in 'ans' is then outputted.
